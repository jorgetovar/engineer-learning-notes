## 1. Distributed Systems Design

For a highly available, fault-tolerant microservice architecture for an actuarial platform, I would implement:

- A domain-driven design approach with bounded contexts to organize microservices around business capabilities
- Event-driven architecture using a message broker like AWS SNS/SQS or Apache Kafka for asynchronous communication
- Circuit breakers (like Hystrix or Resilience4j) to prevent cascading failures
- Service discovery via AWS Cloud Map or Consul
- API Gateway for request routing, throttling, and authentication

For real-time processing with data consistency, I'd implement:

- CQRS pattern separating read/write operations
- Event sourcing where appropriate for audit trails
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Materialized views for complex queries

For eventual consistency issues, I'd use:
- Idempotent operations to safely retry on failures
- Optimistic concurrency with version numbers
- Conflict resolution strategies (last-write-wins or custom merge logic)
- Compensating transactions to roll back when needed

## 2. AWS Deep Dive

For a multi-region DR solution with RPO <5min and RTO <15min:

Primary Services:

- DynamoDB global tables for NoSQL data with multi-region replication
- Amazon Aurora Global Database for relational data
- S3 Cross-Region Replication with versioning enabled
- CloudFormation/Terraform for infrastructure definition

Architecture:
- Active-passive setup with primary in us-east-1, standby in us-west-2
- Route 53 health checks and failover routing policies
- CloudWatch alarms and Lambda functions for automated failover
- AWS Backup with cross-region copy

For faster RTO:
- Pre-provisioned compute capacity in the DR region
- Warm standby with scaled-down replicas of critical services
- Regular DR testing through automated failover exercises
- Lambda functions to scale up resources during failover

## 9. Performance Troubleshooting

For a Node.js application with high latency:

Diagnostic process:
1. Gather metrics from CloudWatch, APM tools (New Relic, Datadog)
2. Analyze request patterns, CPU, memory, I/O, and network metrics
3. Check for event loop blocking with tools like clinic.js
4. Profile application with built-in Node.js profiler or 0x

Specific tools:

- Connection pool exhaustion
- Third-party service latency

Resolution strategies:
- Implement caching layers
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- Move CPU-intensive work to worker threads
- Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies
- Horizontal scaling for CPU-bound workloads

## 10. Architectural Patterns

CQRS vs. Traditional Architecture:

Traditional Architecture:
- Single model for reads and writes
- Simpler to implement and understand
- Direct consistency between reads and writes
- Well-suited for CRUD applications
- Lower operational complexity

CQRS:
- Separate models for reads and writes
- Optimized read models for specific use cases
- Often paired with event sourcing
- Better scalability for read-heavy workloads
- Support for eventual consistency

When to use CQRS in actuarial systems:
- Complex reporting requirements with different views of the same data
- High read-to-write ratio where read performance is critical
- When audit trails and historical snapshots are essential
- When different security models apply to reads vs. writes

Challenges:
- Increased complexity in development and operations
- Managing eventual consistency and explaining it to users
- Data duplication and synchronization overhead
- More complex testing requirements

## 11. Legacy System Migration

Incremental migration approach for a .NET application:

Strategy:
- Strangler Fig pattern to gradually replace functionality
- API Gateway pattern to route requests between legacy and new systems
- Domain-driven design to identify bounded contexts for migration
- Feature flags to control cutover timing

Technical implementation:
1. Encapsulate legacy system behind API layer
2. Implement data synchronization between old and new systems
3. Migrate one bounded context at a time
4. Use blue-green deployments for each component
5. Gradually shift traffic using canary releases

Specific patterns:
- Branch by abstraction for code-level migration
- Parallel change pattern for database schema evolution
- Anti-corruption layer between old and new systems
- Event interception to capture changes in both systems

Risk mitigation:
- Comprehensive monitoring during transition
- Automated rollback procedures
- Side-by-side testing comparing outputs
- Business stakeholder validation at each migration step

## 12. Serverless vs. Container Architecture

Serverless advantages:
- Lower operational overhead
- Automatic scaling to zero when not in use
- Pay-per-use pricing model
- Faster time-to-market for simple services
- Higher developer productivity for straightforward use cases

Container advantages:
- Predictable performance characteristics
- Control over runtime environment
- Better support for longer-running processes
- More consistent local development experience
- Potentially lower costs for steady, predictable workloads

When to choose serverless for actuarial applications:
- Event-driven workloads with variable traffic
- API endpoints with low-to-moderate complexity
- ETL processes and data transformations
- Scheduled tasks like report generation
- When operational costs outweigh infrastructure costs

Tradeoffs:
- Development velocity: Serverless typically faster initially but may have limitations for complex apps
- Operational complexity: Containers require more management but offer more control
- Cost: Serverless better for variable workloads, containers better for predictable high usage
- Vendor lock-in: Serverless typically has higher lock-in risk

## 13. CI/CD Pipeline Design

7. Infrastructure provisioning via Terraform
8. Deployment to staging
9. Automated UI/acceptance tests
10. Production deployment

Database migrations:
- Versioned migration scripts in source control
- Backward compatible changes only
- Schema validation pre-deployment
- Automated rollback procedures
- Blue-green database deployments for major changes

Feature flags:
- Trunk-based development with feature flags

## 14. System Resilience

Designing against cascading failures:

Core patterns:
- Circuit breakers to fail fast when dependencies are unhealthy
- Bulkheads to isolate failures (e.g., separate thread pools)
- Timeouts to prevent resource exhaustion
- Retry with exponential backoff and jitter
- Rate limiting and throttling

Implementation specifics:
- Health checks for all services
- Fail-open or fail-closed strategies based on business impact
- Graceful degradation of non-critical features
- Redundancy for critical components
- Chaos engineering to proactively identify weaknesses

Microservice resilience:
- Service mesh implementation (Istio, Linkerd) for network-level resilience
- Distributed tracing to identify failure points
- Load shedding during peak times
- Static stability with sensible defaults when configuration unavailable
- Idempotent API design for safe retries

## 15. Technical Leadership

Situation: In a previous role, I needed to propose moving from a monolithic application to a microservices architecture for our actuarial platform.

Challenge: The monolith was becoming difficult to maintain and scale, but stakeholders were concerned about:
- Business disruption during transition
- Development team's learning curve
- Cost and timeline uncertainties
- Risk of performance degradation

My approach:
1. Data-driven analysis: I gathered metrics on deployment frequency, failure rates, and performance bottlenecks to quantify current issues
2. POC implementation: Created a small proof-of-concept by extracting one bounded context to demonstrate benefits
3. Incremental roadmap: Developed a phased approach with clear milestones
4. Risk mitigation plan: Detailed testing strategies and rollback procedures
5. Knowledge sharing: Organized training sessions and created internal documentation

Building consensus:
- Met individually with key stakeholders to understand specific concerns
- Created visualization of the target architecture
- Established success metrics agreed upon by all parties
- Included team members in design decisions to build ownership
- Regular transparent updates on progress and challenges

Outcome:
- Successfully migrated three core services within the first quarter
- Deployment frequency improved by 70%
- Mean time to recovery decreased by 60%
- New features were delivered 40% faster in the microservices
- Team gained valuable cloud-native development skills
- Created reusable patterns that accelerated subsequent migrations

The key learning was balancing technical excellence with stakeholder needs by demonstrating incremental value rather than pushing for a "big bang" transformation.
