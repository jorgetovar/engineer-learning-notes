## Notes
### What's Software Engineering

**TL;DR**: A scientific approach to creating Software. Full of information on how to master learning and handle complexity in our field.

- Software Engineering applies a scientific approach to finding solutions to problems.

- Engineering is stuff that works! 

- Software development is the process of discovering and learning, **so we need to become experts at learning and handling complexity**. 

- Software Engineering practices must allow us to build software faster and better. If not, it is just a waste of time. 

- **Software is not a Production problem (physical things with a high cost of replication). Then we need to use different tools for the job such as testability, experiments, and continuous delivery** remember that our real focus is learning and discovery.

- Our Aim as software engineers is to create systems with high Stability and High Throughput (Measuring Performance)

**Stability** = Change Failure Rate + Recover Failure Time
**High Throughput** = Lead time + Frequency of Deployment 

### Optimize for Learning
Learning is a fundamental factor in our job as professionals, and also key in the discovery process of our systems.

- Iterative
- Incremental 
- Empiricism
- Feedback 
- Experimental

The main idea is to focus on small steps gathering feedback and adjusting. 
- Work in a way that allows us to make mistakes 
- Explore the problem and make experiments controlling the variables 
- We need to learn from previous experiences 

## Optimize for handling complexity

Edsger Dijkstra said 
*The art of programming is the art of handling complexity* 

- Cohesion
- Coupling 
- Separation of concerns 
- Modularity 
- Information hiding and abstraction 

The main idea is to focus and keep things simple. 
Remember that `Simple != Easy`

### Tools to support engineering in Software

- Testability
- Deployability
- Controlling the variables 
- Continuous delivery

One of the main takeaways for me in this chapter was tackling problems from:
_Business Vision, Goals > Technical Architecture > Process > Organizational Structure_

instead of  
_Organization Structure>  Business Vision, Goals > Technical Architecture > Processes_

**Conclusion**: this book provides valuable insights about Software Engineering and the practices that allow us to work on a Scientific approach.
