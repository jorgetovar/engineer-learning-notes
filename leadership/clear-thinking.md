# Clear Thinking ðŸ¤”

Rather than merely pursuing victory, the best in the world understand the importance of avoiding defeat. Always strive to be in a favorable position.

**Avoid Letting Biology Override Reason**

Focus on creating a good position that will make your life easier in the future. Reacting without thinking leads to problems and wasted time fixing them.

**Recognize Brain Defaults**

- **Emotion:** Respond to feelings over reasons and facts.
- **Ego:** React to anything threatening self-worth or group hierarchy.
- **Social:** Tend to conform to social norms.
- **Inertia:** Prefer familiar ideas, processes, and environments.

**Overcoming Blind Spots**

Our desire to fit in often overshadows our pursuit of better outcomes. Resistance to change persists even when change is necessary. Create an environment with better defaults.

**Self-Accountability**

Take responsibility for all outcomes. You control how you respond to situations. To achieve greatness, be accountable, accept realities, and take necessary actions.

**Self-Knowledge and Competence**

You are in charge of your circle of competence. Inner dialogues and physical cues affect thinking. Practice deep breathing, pause, and stay calm when making decisions.

**Establish Rules and Filters**

- Make important decisions after waiting and thinking for a few hours.
- Follow exemplars with high standards.
- Little actions compound, becoming allies or enemies.
- Embrace feedback; avoid self-evaluation bias.
- Use others' perspectives to analyze situations.

**Decision-Making Principles**

- Avoid decisions under stress, hunger, or poor sleep.
- Create rules to prevent undesirable actions.
- Add friction to unnecessary tasks; prioritize the important ones.
- Put guardrails in decision-making; use others' perspectives.
- Learn from mistakes and take responsibility.

**Better Decision-Making Process**

- Define the problem, identify root causes, and address them.
- Explore options: Implement bad outcome principle or pre-mortems.
- Visualize second-order effects; explore at least 3 solutions.
- Evaluate options using simple criteria and first principles.
- Connect with experts effectively: Show commitment, be precise, respect time, ask for reasons, and follow up.

**Judgment, Decision, and Execution**

Classify decisions into reversible and consequential. Act as soon as possible for reversible decisions and take time for consequential ones. Build a margin of safety and make small, low-risk bets.

**Leadership Insights**

Commanders provide the "why" and allow the team to make decisions. Waiting for clarity before executing important decisions can be beneficial.

**Outcome vs. Process**

The decision-making process is more crucial than outcomes. Overcome self-serving bias, scrutinize your decision process, and record your thoughts.

**Design Your Own Game**

Life is short; don't play other people's games. Happiness is a combination of health, wealth, and good relationships. Focus on freedom, fitness, and family (FFF). Prioritize health for a fulfilling life, and good judgment is essential for long-term success.
