Do epic sh*t is a book with a lot of takeaways. You probably need to read and reread to learn about habits, money, embracing failure, and having a meaningful life.

## Success and Failure

A year from now, you will wish you had started today
Start today! is probably one of the best pieces of advice in the book.

“The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.”

How we think of our problems is how the world will think of our problems
Happiness is a decision, don’t allow the problems rule you

Persistence isn’t a one-day miracle
Everyone sees success as the result of luck, but the truth is that you need to create luck, hard-work yields results.

Think in the long-term of your actions, the second-order effect of every book, of doing exercise frequently

We just have one life
Why limit ourselves to only one profession. We can blog, play tennis, play chess and be extremely good programmers.

Consistency + Authenticity
Naval Ravikant
 “You can escape competition through authenticity when you realize that no one can compete with you on being you”

They don’t see the journey. Only you do
No one sees how you overcome all the problems and your hard-work

There is a temporary discomfort in doing the unconventional, there is a permanent discomfort in living life as a template.
Money buys freedom!

Hard work is important but most important is what you work on

Time is the only thing that matters! “Time is the new gold”

## Habits

Habits are about identity, exponential growth, and compound results

Three things that will tell you who/what you consider important in your life

The first hour after you wake up (Exercise)
Last hour before you sleep (Read-Chess)
Your calendar (Free as possible- NO meetings)
James Clear
 To create habits:

Clue: Make it obvious, context, trigger
Desire: Identity
Response: Execution
Reward: It should become satisfying

## Awareness

Make sure decisions in your life are made from a point of view of awareness and not ignorance
Your self-talk determines your self-worth: If you don’t believe in yourself then nobody will.
Most decisions in life are reversible: Give serendipity a chance
Authentic people don’t have any competition
We always have two choices: easy one vs right one
Explore as many things as you can before settling down what you want in life
Read books to learn.
Naval Ravikant
 “Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.”

Compounding is the biggest miracle of life
“All returns in life come from a compound interest in long-term games”

## Entrepreneurship

Hiring for your startup? Attitude >> Experience >> Education
Entrepreneurship is the most brutal way to discover yourself
There are peace and wartimes CEOs
Show people who they can be instead of telling who they should be
Value your time

## Money

Income = Accountability + Leverage + Specific Knowledge

Inflation is a thing
Liquidity is critical
Compounding rest on a very important element TIME
Avoid Loans
Avoid renting your time and owning assets
Invest today

## Relationships

The most important relationship is with yourself
Money and time are also a very important relationships of our life
Nothing teaches you better than teaching others
Who you decide to spend your life is one of the biggest decisions you will make in your life
Your parents are first humans
We are the five thoughts we spend the most time with
Conclusion:
Easy read, full of wisdom. A good gift for everyone
