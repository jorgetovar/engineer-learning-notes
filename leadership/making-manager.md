# Making of a Manager

Management is focused on achieving the best outcomes for the team, revolving around three pillars: Purpose (Why), People (Who), and Process (How).

Adaptability is a key trait for managers, requiring the ability to debug teams, show empathy, and exercise good judgment.

Prioritization and communication are crucial management skills. Tools like the Eisenhower matrix help in prioritizing tasks by assessing impact and effort.

Management is distinct from roles that demand uninterrupted focus. It involves supporting individuals, fostering trust, and inspiring action rather than dictating tasks.

Leadership is a skill centered around influencing people. New managers can leverage their "newbie card" to ask questions and seek clarifications.

Effective one-on-one meetings involve asking insightful questions:
- What discussions with past managers were helpful?
- How would you like to be supported?
- What feedback is most useful for you?
- What does a good relationship look like?

In the early months, the focus should be on listening, asking questions, building relationships, and understanding how to support the team best.

Trust is vital. Challenges should be brought to the manager, and feedback should inspire positive change.

Setting clear expectations is crucial. Every major disappointment often results from a failure to establish expectations.

Understanding oneself, managing impostor syndrome, maintaining a growth mindset, and envisioning success contribute to personal growth.

Effective meetings require thoughtful preparation, focused participation, and clear follow-up communication with action items.

A concrete vision, playing to people's strengths, prioritization, and a balance between long and short-term goals are essential in achieving results.

Execution is key. Learn, pivot, double down on what works, and continually iterate toward the desired future.

Delegating tasks that others can do better or equal frees up time for more critical responsibilities.

Cultivate a positive team culture with defined values and expectations. Incentivize behaviors aligned with the team's goals.

Measurement influences behavior. Define the right incentives aligned with organizational values.

In summary, being a manager involves adaptability, effective communication, fostering trust, setting clear expectations, and creating a positive team culture. Successful leadership requires a balance between short-term and long-term goals, effective execution, and delegation of responsibilities.
