# The Hard Thing About Hard Things
is an excellent book full of lessons from an experienced entrepreneur.

Every business book focuses on how to do things perfectly and doesn’t screw them up, but what do you do when you have already had problems?

## Focus

Sometimes the things that you are not doing are the things you should be focused on.

Sometimes as engineers we overemphasize improving things instead of thinking out of the box and looking for the things that we are missing.

## Struggle

Some stuff may or may not help:

Don’t put it all on your shoulders
Technology is extremely complex is like chess (There is always a move)
Play long enough and you might get lucky (Compound effect)
Don’t take it personally (Be too hard with you wouldn't help)

## As a CEO you should be Transparent

Sometimes good news travels very fast and bad news too slowly, making it almost impossible to resolve things

Trust: Telling things as they are is a critical part of building this
The more brains working on the hard problems, the better. In order to create a great company you need to hire good people (Get things done, smart, good communication skills) and let them work on your biggest problem
A good culture needs that bad news travels fast: build a culture that rewards people for getting problems to the table where they can be solved

## Layoffs

Inevitable breaks the company culture

## Firing an executive

Probably your job definition is poor
You hired for lack of weakness rather than for strengths
You failed to integrate the executive (Onboarding process)

## Nobody cares

Spend zero time on what you could have done, and devote all your time to what you might do.

## Company

Strive for a good place to work

## Why you should train your people

In a technology company, people are the most important asset. In any startup, the recruiting and interview process is one of the most important things that need to be executed properly.

Productivity: Training is one of the highest leverage activities a manager can perform
Performance management: set expectations
Product quality: good design, easy to adapt to customer needs
Employee retention: usually people left their jobs because they hate their managers or they weren't learning anything
What you should do first:

The most relevant topics (knowledge and skills required to do their job)
Document architecture nuances maybe using Architecture Decisions Records (ADRs)
Hold regular one on one meetings
Train the managers: management state of the art in technology companies is extremely poor
Enforce Functional and Technical training
As a CEO you should teach the course on management expectations
Product managers

Good product managers take full responsibility and measure themselves in terms of the success of the product
Bad product managers have a lot of excuses (engineers, design, money)
Good product managers are responsible for the right time and the right product
Good product managers define the What, CEO defines the WHY
Good product managers focus on revenue and customers
Good product managers are good communicators, take written positions on important issues

## Little companies execution

In a startup as an executive, nothing happens until you make it happen

What will you do in your first month on the job?
How will your new job differ from your current job?
Why do you want to join a small company?
Aggressively integrate the candidate once onboard

Force them to create
Make sure they get it: bring comprehensive questions about everything
Put them in the mix: require a report from them on what they learned from each person

## Management debt

Make people accountable (schedule, design) who?

## Management quality assurance
Recruiting and Hiring

Sharply understand the skills and talents required to succeed in every position?
Interviewers are well prepared?
Compensation

Make sense for your company demographics?
Performance vs compensation
Training and integration

How long does it take to become productive
Expectations are clear
Performance management

Do your managers give consistent, clear feedback to their employees?
Quality of the written performance reviews?
Motivation

Are your employees excited to come to work?
Do your employees believe in your mission?
Why do employees quit?

## Minimize company politics

Politics: Advancing their careers by means other than merit and contribution

Avoid rewarding behavior that has nothing to do with advancing your business!

Hire people with:

The right kind of ambition: view the world through the team prism
Process: Performance evaluation, organizational design, promotions

## Titles and promotions

Employees want them
Eventually, people need to know who is who
Be aware of the Peter principle (Be promoted to a position in which they are no longer competent)

At the end titles cost nothing. :)

When smart people are bad employees

“If you hold the bus for everyone on the team, then you will be so late you will miss the game, so you can’t do that”

## Old people

Hire old people to acquire knowledge and experience in a specific area

For executives is also important to measure performance:

Results against objectives
Management:
Innovation: Long term vision
Working with peers

## One-on-One

Perhaps the CEO most important operational responsibility is designing and implementing the communication architecture for the company

If we could improve in any way, how could we do it?
What’s the number one problem with our organization? Why?
What’s not fun about working here?
Whom do you admire?
If you were me, what changes would you make?
What don’t you like about the product?
What’s the biggest opportunity we’re missing out on?
What are we not doing that we should be doing?
Are you happy working here?

## Programming your culture
Embrace and rewards some shared values and behaviors

## Scaling your company

Problems:

- Communication
- Common knowledge
- Decision making
- How to do it:

Specialization

Organizational design:

What needs to be communicated
What needs to be decided
Prioritize the most important communication and decisions paths
Decide who’s going to run each group
Identify the paths that did not optimize
Build a plan for mitigating issues
Process: the purpose of the process is communication

Focus on the output first: What should the process produce?
Figure out how you will know if you are getting what you want at each step: measures
Engineer accountability into the system

## Most difficult CEO skill

Focus on the road, not the wall

## Great leaders

Articulate the vision: storytellers
Alignment of interest
Ability to achieve the vision
Wartime CEO “All I have in this world is time, and you are wasting my time”

## CEO

Does the CEO know what to do?

Strategy: Story, Why?
Decision making: Speed and quality of the CEOs decisions
Is easy for employees to contribute to the mission?

## Closing thoughts

We need to be better but we also need to be different
The only way to learn how to be a CEO is to be a CEO
In the absence of hands-on experience, you’d get killed at the moment you took the field
Embrace your weirdness, your background, your instinct
