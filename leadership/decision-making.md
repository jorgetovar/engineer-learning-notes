# Decision making

1. Decision-Making Process:
   - Recognize that decision-making is a skill that is often not explicitly taught.
   - Mental models, our cognitive skill set, play a crucial role in decision making.
   - Be aware of cognitive biases and the potential for misinformation or incorrect information.

2. Critical Decisions:
   - Certain decisions, such as choosing a life partner or deciding where to live, carry significant weight and should be approached with careful consideration.

3. Developing Judgment:
   - Cultivate a strong foundation of knowledge in various disciplines to foster multidisciplinary thinking.
   - Learn the fundamentals of different fields and use them to derive complex ideas.

4. General Thinking Concepts:
   - Utilize concepts such as inversion (considering the opposite), second-order thinking (considering the consequences), and understanding that the map is not the territory (recognizing that models are not reality).

5. Thinking Process:
   - Allocate sufficient time for decision making.
   - Identify the problem clearly.
   - Establish criteria for evaluation.
   - Assign weights to the criteria based on their importance.
   - Evaluate and compare alternatives.
   - Utilize decision matrices for critical and irreversible decisions, conduct reversible experiments for critical decisions, and delegate less critical decisions.

6. Building Judgment:
   - Lay strong foundations for judgment by deeply understanding important concepts and principles.
   - Maintain a decision journal to reflect on past decisions and learn from them.

7. Minimizing Stupidity:
   - Remove external factors that create noise and distract from the decision-making process.
   - Strive to see reality objectively by shedding personal identity and biases.
   - Emphasize a systematic decision-making process rather than relying solely on analysis.

By incorporating these improved ideas into your decision-making approach, you can enhance your ability to make sound and effective choices.
