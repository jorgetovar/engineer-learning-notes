- The golden circle
    * Why > How (Value Proposition) > What
    * People buy why we do it
    * Work with people that believe what you believe (Trust / Loyalty)

- What to expect from manager
    * One-on-One Meetings
    * Feedback and workplace guidance
    * Training and career growth
    * asking for advice is a good way to show respect and trust
