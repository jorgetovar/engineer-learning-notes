4. **Influence Techniques:**

7. **Critical Thinking and Decision-Making:**

**Systems Thinking (Part 2)**

1. **Understanding Systems:**

   - Focus on root causes, not just symptoms.
   - Most outcomes are context-dependent.
   - Correlation and causation are different.

3. **Managing Failure and Improvement:**
   - Be aware of the value of money over time and compounding interest.
   - The probability of an outcome depends on the number of components and connections in the system.
   - Minimize the impact of a failure and conduct a post-mortem to improve the system afterward.

4. **Evaluating Evidence:**
   - When evaluating evidence, consider prior probability, random matches, and the probability of a false positive.
   - Observe and understand things; avoid just remembering names.

5. **Keeping Things Simple:**
