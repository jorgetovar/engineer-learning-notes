# 21 lessons for the 21st century

## Introduction
Yuval Harari's book "21 Lessons for the 21st Century" delves into pressing issues such as climate change, nuclear war, AI, and bioengineering.

## Work
Harari discusses the rise of a potentially useless class of humans and emphasizes the importance of learning as an essential skill.

## Liberty
He warns about the dangers of big data algorithms replacing humans in decision-making, highlighting AI's lack of rebellion and blind obedience to authority. He cautions against human control of algorithms, as human fallibility can lead to wrong decisions and the emergence of authoritarian digital dictatorships. Already, algorithms analyze vast amounts of personal data, determining loan eligibility. Harari cautions against a future where humans become downgraded while relying on upgraded computers, widening the gap between the rich and the poor.

## Equality
Harari predicts that society will split into castes, rendering the masses irrelevant in an AI-dominated world. He notes that applications that gather data possess immense value in the future.

In our increasingly connected world, Harari highlights the paradoxical rise of loneliness and advocates for a more offline-friendly lifestyle. He discusses applications designed to blur the line between online and offline experiences.

## Civilization
Harari celebrates the Olympics as a remarkable achievement of global organization.

## Culture
Culture, as the foundation for large-scale cooperation, is crucial to humanity's success. Harari warns about the perils of being ill-informed.

## Religion
Harari posits that religion and rituals remain important as long as human power relies on mass cooperation and shared fictions.

## Immigration
The contemporary immigration debate revolves around the requirements for acceptance into foreign countries, with varying cultural standards.

## Terrorism
Harari defines terrorism as a tactic used by small powers to spread fear globally through military means.

## War
Superpowers often avoid involvement in wars that do not align with their economic goals.

## Humility
Harari highlights the tendency of every culture to believe in its own significant role in human history, despite only a few truly shaping societal development.

## God
Dogmatic ideas serve as useful behavioral guidelines for humans.

## Secularism
Harari advocates for a reliance on science and facts rather than dogmatic beliefs.

## Ignorance
He emphasizes the need for individual exploration, experimentation, and pursuit of truth to combat groupthink and overcome ignorance.
