# Introduction
- It's easier to find the errors of others than to recognize own mistakes.
- We have to be aware of **biases of intuition**.
- The **heuristic of judgment** is prone to make mistakes.
- Often we substitute hard questions with easier ones, without even noticing them.

# Systems
We have systems to solve problems:
- **Fast**: Intuition, biases, automatic, low effort
- **Slow**: Logic, puzzles, complex tasks, concentrate

## Section 1
The basic elements of the judgments and the decisions are based on our two systems.

- **Least effort**: We use our intuition to avoid wasting energy
- **The Lazy Controller**: System 1 interprets the world and make almost all the decisions until we are faced with difficult calculations o focus on the task 
- **Associative machine**: Primmingm, repeated fallacies are easier to be accepted
- **Cognitive ease**: Repeated experience, priming idea, and good humor make things familiar, seems true, seems good, look easy
- **Conclusions**: We make decisions with little information,  Positive numbers are more unerring
- **Substitutions**: We change the difficult question for easy ones

## Section 2
Why it's too difficult to think in a statistical way
- **Law of lower numbers**: Confidence when in doubt
- **Anchors**: serve as a tipping point
- **Availability**: available information != probability
- **Representatibility**: impressions != probability

## Section 3
We are prone to overestimate what we know about the world, we have an excess of confidence and an illusion of certainty
## Section 4
Dialog with the discipline of the economy
## Section 5
Two me. One experiment, another remember
