Rules of bad studying 

- Passive rereading
- Letting highlights overwhelm you
- Merely glancing at the problem solution and thinking you know how to do it
- Waiting until the last minute to study
- Repeatedly of the same type you already know how to solve
- Neglecting to read the textbook before you start working on problems
- Not checking with your instructors or classmates to clear up points of discussions
- Don't get enough sleep
