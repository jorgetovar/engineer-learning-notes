# learn-to-learn

## Book notes

Learning how to learn can be challenging, but by following a few key ideas, we can make the process more effective and enjoyable.

Here are some tips to help you improve your learning skills:

Sleep: Getting enough sleep is essential for learning as it helps our brains process and consolidate information in the diffuse mode.

Focus mode & Diffuse mode: Switch between concentrated work and wandering freely in the diffuse mode to help your brain process and retain information more effectively.

Interleave: Practice solving the same problem using different techniques to help you master the concept more thoroughly.

Active recall: Rather than just passively reading, actively implement what you've learned and use it in your daily life.

Deliberate practice: Get feedback, practice hard things

Study groups: Sharing your knowledge with others is an effective way to learn and reinforce your understanding.

Tests: Assessing your knowledge through testing helps you recall key ideas and reinforce your understanding of the subject matter.

Metaphors: Using metaphors can help you understand complex ideas in a more enjoyable and memorable way.

Pomodoro technique: Try using this technique to help you focus and relax, and to build your ability to concentrate.


## learning techniques

Effective learning requires effort and strategy. Here are some key ideas that can help you study, practice, and develop the design sensibilities needed to perform effectively:

- Performing is preparing: Approach studying as if you are preparing for a performance. Study, practice, and develop design sensibilities that you can deploy on the fly.
- Break the work into smaller pieces: Tackle complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces.
- Solve the same problem with different approaches: Use multiple approaches to solving the same problem to gain a deeper understanding of the concept.
- Recall: Try to recall what you have learned, and use active recall to reinforce your understanding.
- Focus: Cultivate a focused mindset when studying, and try to eliminate distractions.
- Explanatory questions and simple analogies: Ask explanatory questions and use simple analogies to help you understand complex concepts.
- Smooth repetition creates muscle memory: Practice, repetition, and muscle memory can help you improve your performance.
- Planner journal: Use a planner or journal to help you stay organized and on track.
- Take breaks: Taking regular breaks can help you stay focused and avoid burnout.
- Clue: task : reward: belief: Set up a reward system to motivate yourself to complete tasks.
- Interleave by reading and practicing: Use interleaving to mix up your studying and practice, alternating between reading and practicing.
- Eat your frogs first: Tackle the most difficult tasks first to avoid procrastination and build momentum.
- Make a mental contrast: picture your dreams: Visualize your goals and dreams to help motivate you to work harder.
- Pomodoro technique: Use the Pomodoro technique to break up your work into short, focused bursts.
- Top-down Context and bottom-up are chunks: Use both a top-down context and bottom-up chunks to help you understand complex concepts.
- Eisenhower decision matrix: Use the Eisenhower decision matrix to help you prioritize your tasks based on their urgency and importance.

In addition, here are some "rules of bad studying" to avoid:

- Passive rereading: Avoid passively rereading the material without actively engaging with it.
- Letting highlights overwhelm you: Don't let highlighted material overwhelm you or distract you from the main points.
- Merely glancing at the problem solution and thinking you know how to do it: Don't just glance at the problem solution and assume you understand it.
- Waiting until the last minute to study: Don't wait until the last minute to start studying and preparing for exams or projects.
- Repeating the same types of problems you already know how to solve: Don't focus solely on the problems you already know how to solve. Challenge yourself with new and more difficult problems.
- Neglecting to read the textbook before you start working on problems: Always read the textbook before starting on practice problems.
- Not checking with your instructors or classmates to clear up points of discussion: Don't hesitate to reach out to instructors or classmates to clarify points of discussion.
- Not getting enough sleep: Ensure you get enough sleep, as it is essential for learning and memory consolidation.
