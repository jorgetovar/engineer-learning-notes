The JVM ecosystem has been incredible for many years. Pretty amazing languages such as Scala, Kotlin, and Clojure, libraries, IDEs, and excellent books. Java 19 with the Loom Project supports a high-throughput, lightweight concurrency model.Â 

I believe Java is in the right direction to become a better language. Today I used some of the new features, although it is not as expressive as the other JVM languages. I enjoyed working with this version.

Records, Pattern Matching, Sealed classes, switch as expressions, type inference, and many more. I hope shortly the companies start looking at Java as a good option for startups.
