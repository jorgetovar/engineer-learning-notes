# Contributing to this notes
I would love your feedback!

I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Typos
- Proposing new books
- Fix links
- Ideas to improve the doc
- Code implementations and examples

**We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests**

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase
