# Contributing to this notes
I would love your feedback!

I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Typos
- Proposing new books
- Fix links
- Add your ideas


### We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)).
