# Engineer learning notes

Learning is an essential skill in the era of information, you have to choose your skills wisely, dedicate time to learning, and make learning a part of your job.

to prioritize what topics to study I have found the [Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) amazing. It keeps me humble and hungry.

To get a better result in your Study you have to:
- **Study**
- **Build**
- **Share**

Share is what motivates me to write my notes  this repository. Big thanks to [Yevgeniy](https://www.ybrikman.com) and his blog posts. Insightful with a lot of good ideas and takeaways. Now I can appreciate design, metrics, and culture from another perspective.

## Lastly, Reading books is part of the process to get better when you are a *maker*, like almost all Software Developers, writing and taking notes helps you to organize your thoughts.
